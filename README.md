# Reverse Engineering Professional notes 
## What are these notes for?
The aim for these notes kept in this repository serve the purpose of preparing you for the **certification exam** of "eLearnSecurity Certified Reverse Engineer". The INE course these notes come from is a **Practice-based** course with dozens of guided exercises that will challenge your mind with hardcore technical topics. This aims to consolidate your knowledge of the following:
- **Start from the basics** up to highly technical chapters
- Learn about **IA-32 CPU Architecture**
- Learn about **functions**, **stack frames**, **heaps**, **exceptions**, important **Ring3 Windows internal structures**, **PE file format**
- Master **ImmunityDBG**
- Learn different methods to locate the **important algorithms**
- Understand and bypass **Anti-Reversing techniques**
- Perform **full manual unpacking** on packed executables
