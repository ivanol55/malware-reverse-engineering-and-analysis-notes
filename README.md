# Reverse Engineering Professional notes 
## What are these notes for?
The aim for these notes kept in this repository serve the purpose of teaching you about reverse engineering and malware analysis. This information is gathered from the INE courses for the **certification exams** of "eLearnSecurity Certified Reverse Engineer" and "eLearnSecurity Certified Malware Analyst Professional". The INE courses these notes come from are **Practice-based** courses with dozens of guided exercises that will challenge your mind with hardcore technical topics. This aims to consolidate your knowledge of the following:
- **Start from the basics** up to highly technical chapters
- Learn about **IA-32 CPU Architecture**
- Learn about **functions**, **stack frames**, **heaps**, **exceptions**, important **Ring3 Windows internal structures**, **PE file format**
- Work with **realistic malware samples** created to prepare you for real-world samples
- Analyze real-world samples: **ransomware**, **botnets**, **rats**, etc.
- Explore an entire module dedicated to **x64 bit assembly**
- Dive into the **TLS** method
- Understand how malware uses **Windows APIs** to achieve their malicious activity
- **Debug samples** using different debuggers
